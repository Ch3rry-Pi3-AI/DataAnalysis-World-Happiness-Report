# Data Import â€“ World Happiness

This branch of the project is focused on **importing raw datasets** into the bronze layer.
The following dataset is imported here and will later be processed:

* World Happiness Report 2021

## Project Structure

The new modules are stored in `src/get_data/`:

```
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ get_data/                               ðŸ†• (NEW)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py                         ðŸ†•
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ import_happiness_data.py            ðŸ†•
â””â”€â”€ data/           
    â””â”€â”€ bronze/     # raw input datasets        ðŸ†•
```

* `import_happiness_data.py` â†’ Downloads and extracts the World Happiness Report 2021 dataset.
* `app.py` â†’ Updated to provide a single entry point for running data imports.

## How to Run

You can import the data in two different ways depending on your workflow:

### 1) Run via the app entry point (recommended)

From the project root:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will call the import script from a central location.

### 2) Run the happiness data import directly

From the project root:

```bash
python -m src.get_data.import_happiness_data
```

## Output

* World Happiness CSVs will be stored under the `data/bronze/` folder.
* The script provides clear step-by-step logging (when `verbose=True`) and finishes with a completion message.

## Notes

* This script is designed for the bronze stage of the medallion architecture.
* Data stored here is raw and may be transformed later in the silver and gold stages.
* All modules follow a consistent style with NumPy docstrings, step banners, and beginner-friendly comments.
